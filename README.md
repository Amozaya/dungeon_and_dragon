## Instructions how to play

The game is a text based, so it is important that user reads all the instructions in the terminal.

In order to act in the game, or chose the options, user has to type the command in the terminal and press `Enter`. Text is not case sensetive, so it won't matter if user wites command in all lower or all capitilized characters. Possible commands always will be displayed in text instructions, so it is important to enter text identical to the options provided. If user enter incorrect command the program will give an eror message and ask user to enter correct command.

There is only one type of attack available for the user, however, it got a chance of a critical attack which deals higher damage.

The game is turn based, so when user attacks the dragon the user's turn is over and then computer's turn starts.

User can also use `Potion` to restore the health, however, using the potion will end your turn, meaning you can't attack the same turn as you use the potion.

To win the game user has to defeat the dragon before it kills them. 

It is possible to try and `escape` the fight, but it got a low chance of succseeding.
